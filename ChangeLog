	  bugfix: handle ObjectNotFoundException on session.get()
	  
	  After updating hibernate to version 3.3.1 (revision 14573)
	  session.get() behaves differently.
	  Instead of returning null an ObjectNotFoundException is thrown if
	  the object that would be retrieved was deleted before and is
	  still associated with the session. This is the case if and object
	  is updated (results in delete and create event).
