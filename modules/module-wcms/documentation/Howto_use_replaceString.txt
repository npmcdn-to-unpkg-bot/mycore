This tool provides a quick and dirty method to change style values in a list of XSL-Stylesheets.
============================================================================
============================================================================

Why I should use this:
=================
Right now the problem is that is not really fast and easy to change the web layout of the mycore
application. 
WCMS is forcing a big progress in managing layout, but it is not able to do all the work that should be done.

One thing which might be done better next time are the XSL-Stylesheets.
Therein you have to change CSS-EnTries manually XSl by XSL.
In order to do this just one time you can use the replaceString.sh script.


How to use:
==========
1. Go to your folder the stylesheets you want to change are located
	e.g.: cd $DOCPORTAL_HOME/stylesheets
	
2. Find out the string value you want to change 
	e.g.: left:55px;
	
3. Execute Script
	/$DOCPORTAL_HOME/modules/wcms/unixtools/replaceString.sh left:55px; left:288px;
	
This will be change all left:55px; into left:288px; entries within the stylesheets within the folder you have executed the 
script from.
Also a archive folder will be added, where you can find the original file before changed by script.
