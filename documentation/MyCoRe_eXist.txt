Use eXist with MyCoRe-Sample under Windows XP Professional       08.07.2003

eXist supports the XML:DB-interface. Before you start change build.xml in
mycore-directory from

 <property name="persistency"  value="cm7"/>

 <property name="persistency"  value="xmldb"/>

1. download eXist from http://exist-db.org/

2. to install it run java -jar eXist-0.9.1-install.jar on the commandline
   may be that this step is not necessary and you use step 3 instead

3. in this version there is a bug, so after installation download 
   the development version from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17691
   I had to add mysql.jar, xalan-2.3.1.jar, xercesImpl.jar and xmpl-apis.jar to lib/core 
   directory of eXist 

4. in client.properties of eXist 
   # uncomment following line if you want to access a
   # stand-alone server
   uri=xmldb:exist://localhost:8081

5. To test, if all is ok start eXist as server application by running startup.bat in 
   directory bin

6. put url http://localhost:8080/exist/index.xml in your browser. You should see the eXist 
   homepage on your machine. If there are any problems consult ...
   steps 5 and 6 should be done once

7. if all is ok, run server.bat in the bin-directory

8. now generate the collections with client.bat

   mkcol mycore
   chown guest guest mycore
   cd mycore
   mkcol legalentity
   chown guest guest document
   mkcol document
   chown guest guest document
   mkcol derivate
   chown guest guest derivate

9. now set in mycore.properties.private

   MCR.persistence_type=xmldb
   MCR.persistence_xmldb_driver=org.exist.xmldb.DatabaseImpl
   MCR.persistence_xmldb_database_url=xmldb:exist://localhost:8081/db/mycore
   MCR.persistence_xmldb_database=exist

   make sure that the cm7 and cm8 persistence types are deactivated, add # at the beginning
   of the line

10. copy exist/exist.jar and exist/core/xmlrpc-1.1.jar to the lib directory of mycore
    make sure that xindice.jar is NOT in this directory

11. Try to load legal entities into mycore/legalentity collection
    This is done by running ant legal in the mycore-sample-application directory
    if all ist ok you can view the xml-data by using exist/bin/client.bat

12. If all is ok you can run ant documents to load the documents 

13. If all is ok you can run ant derivates to load the derivates 

On my system all these step worked. With the actual mycore-sample application
in combination with MySQL I could view listing of legal entities and documents.

Searching works pretty good. In the search mask for documents type in datafield
Title       eide        and in datafield
Freetext    2000

you should get MyCoReDemoDC_document_0001 in your resultlist

"More documents" in the result of a legalentity search doesn't work.
Furthermore are problems with national characters.
