Use MySQL with MyCoRe-Sample under Windows XP Professional       16.06.2003

1. download MySQL from http://www.mysql.com/ (http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-4.0.html)

2. install MySQL, you need administrator privileges, my installation directory is c:\mysql

3. install MySQL-Server, follow the instructions in mysql\Docs\manual.html
   I did it by typing 

   C:\mysql\bin> mysqld-max-nt --install

   If you don't want MySQL installed as a service use  

   C:\mysql\bin\mysqld-max-nt --standalone

4. To check if all is ok I started the WinMySQLAdmin tool. You find it in c:\mysql\bin  
   The icon of this programm is a traffic light. If it shows green all is ok.
   You can use this tool, to view the databases and the table- and columnnames.
   Note: if you create a new table restart WinMySQLAdmin
   Attention: if you start WinMySQLAdmin, it will be minimized immediately. To resize
              click the traffic light icon    

5. Now create the database for MyCoRe. I started MySQL by typing mysql on the
   commandline. 

   mysql> create database mycore;
   
   you can quit the command by typing quit

   this database can be deleted by typing

   c:\mysql\bin>mysqladmin drop mycore

6. next change in the jdbc-section of config\mycore.properties.private

   MCR.persistence_sql_database_url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/mycore?user=user

   may be, that you have to take another user

7. in config\mycore.properties.jdbc you have to use the following database driver:

   MCR.persistence_sql_driver=org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver

8. now you can load the classifications into the database mycore
   this is done by running ant class in the mycore-sample-application directory
